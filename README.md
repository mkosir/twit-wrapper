# twit-wrapper
A heavily opinionated wrapper around [twit](https://www.google.com) library.  
This is a small utility wrapper library that is implemented with facade pattern which translates twit library's existing interface into simplified one.
Only most commonly used function for interacting with Twitter API are implemented:
- postTweet(msg)
- getTweets(keyword, fromDate)
